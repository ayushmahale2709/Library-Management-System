# ðŸ“š Library Management System (Console Based)

### ðŸ”¹ Project Description

This is a simple **console-based Java project** made for practicing CRUD operations.
The program allows the user to manage a small library by **adding, viewing, searching, updating, and removing books**.
It uses basic concepts of **OOP, ArrayList, and Scanner input** in Java.

---

### ðŸ”¹ Features

1. **Add Book** â†’ Enter title, author, and ISBN to add a new book.
2. **View Books** â†’ See the list of all books available in the library.
3. **Search Book** â†’ Find a book by its title.
4. **Update Book** â†’ Update book details using ISBN (can change title, author, or ISBN).
5. **Remove Book** â†’ Remove a book by its ISBN.
6. **Exit** â†’ Close the program.

---

### ðŸ”¹ How It Works

* The program shows a **menu** to the user.
* User chooses an option (1â€“6).
* Based on input, the required operation (CRUD) is performed.
* Data is stored in an **ArrayList of Book objects** while the program runs.
* Since this is a console program, once you exit, data is not saved permanently.

### ðŸ”¹ Technologies Used

* **Language**: Java
* **Concepts**: Classes & Objects, ArrayList, Loops, Scanner Input, CRUD

### ðŸ”¹ Sample Menu (Console Output)

```
--- Library Management System ---
1. Add Book
2. View All Books
3. Search Book by Title
4. Remove Book by ISBN
5. Update Book by ISBN
6. Exit
Enter your choice:
```

### ðŸ”¹ Example Run

```
--- Library Management System ---
1. Add Book
2. View All Books
3. Search Book by Title
4. Remove Book by ISBN
5. Update Book by ISBN
6. Exit
Enter your choice: 1

Enter book title: The Alchemist
Enter author name: Paulo Coelho
Enter ISBN: 12345
Book added successfully!
```

### ðŸ”¹ Future Improvements

* Save books permanently using **file handling** or **database**.
* Add user login system.
* Improve search to check by author or ISBN.

---

### ðŸ”¹ Outcome

A working **Library Management System** that demonstrates CRUD operations in Java using console input and output. This project helped me practice **basic programming, OOP, and data handling with ArrayList**.
